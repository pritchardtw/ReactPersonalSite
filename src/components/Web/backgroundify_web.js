        loads a url in an invisible browser, takes a screen shot, and sets it as the device wallpaper (background). This is a
        fairly simple page, but I wanted to be able to have a website to use in Backgroundify that has
        nice pictures. Eventually I will add more pages with updating images that enable a user to have
        rotating pictures as their background with a single backgroundify url."
