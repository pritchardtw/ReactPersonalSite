        and total number of teams. I query an API for tournament details, teams, and matchups. I then render all the matchups of
        the tournament. I query the api for each matchup to determine the winner, and they move on to the next round. After
        each winner is determined, I color in the respected matchup in the dom. Eventually, there is only one winner, and that
        is displayed to the dom."
