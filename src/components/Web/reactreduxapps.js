        I've found a course by Stephen Grider. Students such as myself learn the newest react and es6 practices complete with Babel and Webpack.
        So far I've followed the course to construct a youtube video search pictured below, which was used to introduce us to react. Next we built a simple
        book explorer with react and redux to get introduced to redux's state management concepts of reducers, actions, and action creators. We then built
        a weather app using open weather API, Sparklines, and google maps javascript libraries. In this app you can enter a city and get a brief understanding
        of the upcoming weather."
