        an ALU (arithmetic logic unit), a dip switch input, a pushbutton input, and 3 LEDs (red yellow green). We wrote some assembly code to create a
        security program where you input a code to the dip switch, hit the button, and see if the light turns green or red. Additionally, we programmed
        the LEDs to act like a stoplight."
